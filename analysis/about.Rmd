      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Qure AR was founded with a simple yet ambitious vision: to make augmented reality technology accessible, useful, and transformative for everyone. Born from the intersection of cutting-edge computer vision research and practical user experience design, we're building the foundation for the next generation of AR applications.</p>
      
      <p>Our journey began when our founders recognized that while AR technology was advancing rapidly, the gap between technological capability and practical usability was growing wider. We set out to bridge this gap by creating AR solutions that don't just showcase technology for its own sake, but solve real problems and enhance human capabilities.</p>
